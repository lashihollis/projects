import numpy as np --import np library

np.array()--creates a numpy array usually looks like a python list
np.genfromtxt('file', delimiter=',')--imports data from csv into an array (change delimiter based on specific file delimeter)

# With an array --numpy eliminates the need for a for loop
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a = np.array(l)
a_plus_3 = a + 3


When adding or subtracting arrays in NumPy, each element will be added/subtracted to its matching element. 
(They have to have the same number of elements)
>>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
>>> b = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
>>> a + b
array([ 7,  9, 11, 13, 15])

If the arrays that make up our bigger array are all the same size, then it has a special name: a two-dimensional array.
A two-dimensional array is a list of lists where each list has the same number of elements.

Selecting elements from a 2-d array is very similar to selecting them from a 1-d array, we just have two indices to select from. 
The syntax for selecting from a 2-d array is a[row,column] where a is the array.
A two-dimensional array has two axes: axis 0 (y) represents the values that share the same indexical position (are in the same column), 
and axis 1 (x) represents the values that share an array (are in the same row).

example:
import numpy as np

student_scores = np.array([[92, 94, 88, 91, 87],
                           [79, 100, 86, 93, 91],
                           [87, 85, 72, 90, 92]])

each row is the test # and each column is each student's grades

tanya_test_3 = student_scores[2,0]
cody_test_scores = student_scores[:,4]

print(cody_test_scores)
