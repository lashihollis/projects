Statistics using NumPy

import numpy as np

allergy_trials = np.array([[6, 1, 3, 8, 2], 
                           [2, 6, 3, 9, 8], 
                           [5, 2, 6, 9, 9]])

total_mean = np.mean(allergy_trials)
trial_mean = np.mean(allergy_trials, axis = 1) --row
patient_mean = np.mean(allergy_trials, axis = 0) --column

print(total_mean)
print(trial_mean)
print(patient_mean)

--------
np.mean()--mean or average of your array

np.sort()--helps sort your array values to identify outliers

np.median()--finds the median of your data set

----------
np.percentile(data_set, percentile)--shows data in your specified percentile
    The 25th percentile is called the first quartile
    The 50th percentile is called the median
    The 75th percentile is called the third quartile
The minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of a dataset are called a five-number summary. 
The difference between the first and third quartile is a value called the interquartile range.

50% of the dataset will lie within the interquartile range. The interquartile range gives us an idea of how spread out our data is. 
The smaller the interquartile range value, the less variance in our dataset. The greater the value, the larger the variance.

import numpy as np

movies_watched = np.array([2, 3, 8, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 7, 2])

first_quarter = np.percentile(np.sort(movies_watched), 25)
third_quarter = np.percentile(np.sort(movies_watched), 75)
interquartile_range = third_quarter - first_quarter

print(first_quarter)
print(third_quarter)
print(interquartile_range)
------------------
standard deviation
The standard deviation tells us the spread of the data. The larger the standard deviation, the more spread out our data is from the center. 
The smaller the standard deviation, the more the data is clustered around the mean.
